# Adoption

What METHOD.md has taken in from the case studies, when, and on what
evidence, and what is still pending. There is one row per proposal in a case
study's list "What METHOD.md should say differently", and one per practice
the owner adopted without a proposal.

**This file is the current adoption state.** A case study's heading records the
state when the case study was written, and is not updated afterwards. For
example, case study 3's says "the owner's to settle".
`python tools/check_method.py` holds this file's ids against the case studies'
lists, and every adopted row's headings against METHOD.md.

**Statuses.**

- **adopted at `<commit>`**: in METHOD.md since that commit, under the
  heading or headings named. A rule split across two sections names both,
  separated by ` ; `.
- **to adopt, round 6**: practised in a later round, so adopted in round 6
  (2026-10-02) at the owner's word, "Everything practised (Recommended)".
  At the round's end it becomes **adopted at `<commit>`**.
- **to adopt in part, round 6**: the same, for only the part that was
  practised, which the status names.
- **pending**, or **not adopted**: not in METHOD.md. The reason is given. A
  pending proposal is the owner's to settle.

**Ids.**

- `CSn#k` is the k-th proposal in case study n's list.
- `B` rows are practices from cft-fp256's later rounds that nobody proposed
  (the survey's Table B).
- `R` rows are safeguards that practice had dropped, restored.
- `S` rows are adaptations allowed with their conditions.

**Evidence.** The survey of 2026-10-02,
[archive/round6-practice-survey.md](archive/round6-practice-survey.md), gives
each row's evidence of practice, file and line. Much of the cft-fp256 evidence
is in that project's gitignored `Data/runs/` and is not public. Its
`docs/VALIDATION.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` are public, and pinned at
`4190a47`. That is a stated limit of this file's evidence.
