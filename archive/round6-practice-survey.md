# Which proposals were practised: the survey of 2026-10-02

A fact-gatherer agent wrote this on 2026-10-02, read-only, for round 6's plan.
The lead re-read these of its claims at their sources:
- the send-back rule's origin (ODE lead.md:1055-1060);
- "no Monitor" (CERT lead.md:951);
- verifiers reading the parcel's ledger (S56 briefs/verifier-W1.md:13);
- parcels owning their docs (S56 briefs/S1.md:46-56);
- main moving once per round (ODE lead.md:1523);
- the brief-errors line absent from all 37 cft-fp256 parcel briefs since 2026-09-25 (a grep of every `Data/runs/*/briefs/*.md` under several phrasings; the 55 verifier briefs never carried it);
- round 5's dispatch as "sonnet" (loganw-dev-ledger lead.md:275);
- SPEC decision 19 (loganw.dev SPEC.md:143-144).

The other rows are the agent's reading, cited so they can be checked.

**Path key.**
- `M` is ParcelRound METHOD.md; `T/` is its templates.
- `R4a` and `R4b` are round 4's first and second ledgers, from `archive/round4-ledger.zip` and `round4-second-ledger.zip`.
- `P` is loganw.dev `docs/ROUND1.md`; `SPEC` and `LVAL` are that repository's `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/VALIDATION.md`; `L` is `loganw-dev-ledger/` (loganw.dev's round ledger, local).
- cft-fp256's round directories, under `Data\runs\`: ODE (2026-09-25), CERT (09-28), REV7 (09-29), AUD (09-29), FIX (09-30), S56 (09-30), LANG (10-01), S6 (10-02, live).
- `RM` and `VAL` are cft-fp256's `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/VALIDATION.md` at `4190a47`.
- "ODE lead:1057" means that round's `ledger/lead.md:1057`, and "S56 b/S1:25" means `briefs/S1.md:25`.

## Summary

| case study | practised in a later round | in part | only in the round that proposed it | no evidence | total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CS3 | 11 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 18 |
| CS4 | 19 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 23 |
| CS5 | 4 | 0 | 8 | 1 | 13 |
| all | 34 | 8 | 9 | 3 | 54 |

**Corrected 2026-10-02 15:43 by the lead**, on a verifier's finding. The agent counted CS4#19 and CS4#23 as practised in a later round. But round 4's second round (R4b) is where both were proposed: observations 29 and 31 sit under "Observations from the second round" (CS4:225-246). By the survey's own text, #19 was later replaced by verifying the work instead, so it counts as origin-only. #23 is practised later only in part, in the fixes round, so it counts as in part. The agent first wrote 36 / 7 / 8 / 3.

For round 5, the owner applied CS3 and CS4 by decision: SPEC decision 19, with 26 of the 41 listed as rules in force. 25 of them are at P:136-189, and CS3#4 is at P:200-201. Not among them:
- CS3: #1, #5 (only in part, via P:148), #6, and #12 to #18 (#17 is in b/_common but not in the plan);
- CS4: #3, #4, #19, #22 and #23.

## Table A: the 54 proposals

**CS3** (`CASE-STUDY-3.md`)

| id | proposal | type | § | practised? (evidence) | conflicts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CS3#1 L633 | Brief a send-back as a new agent when it can't be resumed; give the fixer the report, ledger and worktree | reversal | §8/§3 | **yes**, S56 only: lead:500-508; b/S1-sendback:1-9 ("its ledger is your memory"); S3- and S4-sendback briefs. Other rounds resumed the same agent: R4a lead:182, 344; ODE lead:581-583 (SendMessage); L lead:516, 529 | reverses M:786-790 |
| CS3#2 L638 | The stamp rule in T/ledger and in every brief, fixers' included; typed stamps err in both directions | reinforcement | §4 | **yes**, but the template never changed. R4a README:50-52 (it repeats the old "ahead" claim), b/P1:83, b/P2:106, b/P3:98; P:164, 198; L README:45-49 ("missed in both directions"); L b/_common:98; ODE 7/7 briefs (b/verifier-V4:67); AUD README:3; every later cft brief; a fixer's brief at S56 b/S1-sendback:62. A lapse at ODE lead:182-190 | corrects M:349-352 |
| CS3#3 L644 | A parcel's question for the lead goes in urgent/, and the brief says so | reinforcement | §4 | **yes** in R5: P:165, L README:66, b/_common:96-97; used in L urgent/P2-film-thread-door.md and P4-snapshot-…md. REV7 used it (urgent/P2-proposals.md:1-2). R4a has the template text only (README:77-80). From AUD on, replaced by the ledger plus direct messages (B6) | none |
| CS3#4 L650 | Archive the ledger from the working copy, keeping its timestamps | extension | §4 | **yes**: the round-4 zip has 14 entries with 13 distinct original mtimes; the round-5 zip has 38 entries with 33; L README:5-6; P:200-201. cft never archived; it keeps the working copies (ODE README:62-69) | none |
| CS3#5 L657 | A watch's expiry is when to re-arm and do a full read | reinforcement | §4 | **yes** in R5: P:147-149; L lead:31-32, 69; b/_common:94-95. **Partly** in R4a: lead:71-72 (re-armed an hour late). **No** in cft: ODE lead:584; CERT lead:951 | none |
| CS3#6 L661 | The lead watches urgent/ continuously and reads the rest at set points | reversal | §4 | **partly**, in R5 only and not as a rule: L lead:26, 31, 446, 870, 69. R4a watched the whole directory (lead:333-336). cft dropped urgent/ | reverses M:463-469; T/check:65-68; T/ledger:115-116 |
| CS3#7 L672 | The lead's seam commits and its records (VALIDATION entry, commit messages) go past a verifier before main moves | reinforcement + new | §5/§7 | **yes, strongly.** R4a lead:471-484. R5 P:153-154, broken at L lead:626 and remedied by b/verifier-seam:17-24, 209-210; L lead:956, 1142; LVAL:1782, 1887. ODE lead:1071, 1444-1457, push 1523. VAL:15647, 15851.

| CS3#8 L679 | A verifier's list includes the lead's grants and rulings made after dispatch | new | §6 | **partly.** R5 P:173-174, and b/verifier-seam:183 attacks a grant (L lead:465). In cft they are required reading, not items to attack: S56 b/verifier-W1:13, W2:14, W3:15; LANG VL1:17, VL3:25; FIX F2:15; AUD A2:17; S6 VR8:15 | none |

| CS3#11 L694 | Freeze what is audited | new | §7 | **yes**: R4a verifier-P0:5, 420, 717 (fresh clones); P:16-17, 182-183; L lead:33-34; b/verifier-parcel:50-56. Every cft verifier brief but one names a frozen tree (ODE lead:1038, S56 W1:15, LANG VL1:21); drafts are frozen too (LANG lead:321) | none |

| CS3#15 L713 | Decide per round whether the lead sits between verdict and fix | new | §8 | **no evidence.** The lead sat between verdict and fix every time (ODE lead:1019-1036; S56 lead:362-371) | none |
| CS3#16 L719 | A verifier may reuse a run with identical inputs | relaxation | §6 | **partly**: FIX b/verifier-F4:69 (reuse by run id and commit); ODE b/verifier-V4:35 ("read, do not rerun") | relaxes M:600-601, 608-609; T/verifier:37-38 |
| CS3#17 L725 | Fast-forward to the base and check its SHA; never switch another session's branch; watch CI for "cancelled" | reinforcement | §3 | **yes, except the CI part**: b/_common:12-21; b/verifier-parcel:63-66; CERT b/P1c:16, b/P2c:10, b/P3b:10; ODE lead:1370; REV7 lead:29 | none |
| CS3#18 L732 | A sweep is a round | extension / replacement | §7 | **partly**: no sweep ran later. Read-only surveyors worked at a fixed SHA before a verified plan: CERT lead:17; LANG lead:7, 11-18; S6 surveys/README:3-5 | replaces M:701-703 for a standalone sweep |

| CS4#12 L334 | The lead's decisions go in the ledger first, then the message | reinforcement | §4 | **yes** in R4a (lead:409-410, 428) and R5 (P:150). cft records every decision it messages (AUD lead:45, 67, 86; S6 b/verifier-VR8:26), but not their order | none |

## Where later practice departs from METHOD.md and the templates

| METHOD.md or template says | later practice | where |
|---|---|---|
| delete the ledger, or archive it when the case study cites it by time (M:494-498; T/ledger:11-13; T/check:100-101) | cft keeps every round's ledger as its record | B15 |
| `urgent/` and watchers (M:365-445; T/ledger:62-122; T/brief:38-45; T/check:56-61) | abandoned in cft from AUD on | B6 |
| the lead watches the whole directory (M:446-501; T/check:65-68) | the cert round's lead kept none; the rev7 round's read the ledger through one; from the audit round on, the ledgers do not say (corrected by the lead) | ODE lead:584; CERT lead:951; REV7 lead:768; S56 lead:386 |
| read the ledger at three moments (M:331-334; T/brief:33-36) | later cft parcel briefs say only "append only" | S56 b/S1:77-80 |
| a ledger README (T/ledger:3-5; T/check:53) | absent from FIX on | B7 |
| "anything you found that the brief got wrong" (M:227-228, "the highest-yield sentence in the whole system"; T/brief:114-115; T/check:40) | **in none of the 37 cft parcel briefs since 2026-09-25** (the 55 verifier briefs never carried it); rounds 4 and 5 kept it (R4a b/P1:99; L b/_common:233) | the lead's grep, 2026-10-02 |
| verifiers re-run the gate and the rest themselves (M:600-601, 608-609; T/verifier:37-38) | relaxed by B4 | FIX b/verifier-F4:69 |
| a send-back needs no re-brief (M:786-790) | S56 re-dispatched fresh agents | CS3#1 |
| published docs are the lead's alone (M:691-693; T/brief:74-75) | cft parcels write their own docs; only VALIDATION, ROADMAP and CLAUDE.md stay the lead's | S56 b/S1:46-56 |
| a staging branch per merge, main moving on each verdict (M:694-699) | a round branch; main moves at the round's end or at milestones, not per merge (corrected by the lead: the cert round pushed a hotfix first, the language round twice) | ODE lead:1523; CERT lead:354, 1182; LANG lead:367, 700; S6 lead:727 |
| P0 pushed before any parcel (M:107-108) | parcels branch from an unpushed round branch | LANG lead:49; S6 lead:214 |
| parcels' self-reports kept from a verifier until it forms its own view (M:440-444) | verifier briefs start with the parcel's whole ledger | S56 b/verifier-W1:13 |
| cost from the agent cards, in the summary to the owner (M:704-707) | no later round records any cost | — |
| verdicts: confirmed / defect / not determined (T/verifier:91-96) | kept, and each finding is also labelled (a), (b) or other | B3 |

## Retracted or superseded

- CS3#13 is partly superseded by CS4:250-258, which uses only the processed figure.
- CS4#13 is qualified by CS5:154-157 and CS5#5: an allowlist drawn where two parsers agree did hold.
- CS3#7 and CS4#1 are widened by CS5#1 ("all round, not only P0") and carried to the case study by CS5#11.
- No case study retracted CS3#1, #3 or #6. cft simply dropped `urgent/`.

## Caveats (the survey's own)

- No transcripts were read: the final reports to the owner and the dispatch messages are unknown.
- S6 is live: its brief count rose from 16 to 19 during the survey, so the counts are as of about 14:30.
- R4b evidence comes from its ledger, not from the Quantum-Film repository.
